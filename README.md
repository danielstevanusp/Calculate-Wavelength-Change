the calculate wavelength change function computes the change in wavelength (δλ) between two given wavelengths, lambda1 and lambda2. the formula used is simple:

input:
- lambda1: the initial wavelength in meters.
- lambda2: the final wavelength in meters.

how to use:
run python3 calculate-wavelength-change.py
1. users are prompted to input the initial wavelength (lambda1) and the final wavelength (lambda2) when running the program.
2. the program calculates the change in wavelength using the calculate_wavelength_change function.
3. the result, representing the change in wavelength (δλ), is displayed in meters.

example:

enter the initial wavelength (lambda1) in meters: 5.0
enter the final wavelength (lambda2) in meters: 7.5
the change in wavelength (δλ) is: 2.5 meters

disclaimer: sorry if there are errors and calculations in the code, i'm still learning to improve it.
